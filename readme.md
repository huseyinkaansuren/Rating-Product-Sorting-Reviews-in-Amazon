# Rating Product & Sorting Reviews in Amazon


## Business Problem

In e-commerce, one of the most significant challenges is the accurate calculation of post-purchase ratings for products. Solving this problem means providing more customer satisfaction for the e-commerce site, enhancing product visibility for sellers, and ensuring a seamless shopping experience for buyers. Another challenge is the proper sorting of product reviews. The prominence of misleading reviews can directly impact product sales, leading to both financial loss and customer attrition. By addressing these two fundamental problems, both the e-commerce site and sellers can increase their sales, while customers can seamlessly complete their purchasing journey.
